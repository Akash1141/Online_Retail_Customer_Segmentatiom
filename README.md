Online Retail Customer Segmentation
This project aims to identify major customer segments for an online retail company specializing in selling unique all-occasion gifts. The provided dataset contains transactional information for the period between 01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011. The company serves both individual customers and wholesalers.

Problem Statement
The objective of this project is to analyze the customer data and segment customers based on their purchasing behavior and characteristics. Customer segmentation will provide insights into different types of customers and help tailor marketing strategies to target specific customer groups. By understanding customer segments, the company can improve customer satisfaction, personalize offers, and optimize overall business performance.

Dataset
The dataset, named "Online_Retail.xlsx," contains the following columns:

InvoiceNo: Unique identifier for each transaction
StockCode: Unique identifier for each product
Description: Description of the product
Quantity: Number of items purchased in each transaction
InvoiceDate: Date and time of the transaction
UnitPrice: Price of each item
CustomerID: Unique identifier for each customer
Country: Country where the customer is located
Project Workflow
Data Loading and Assessment: The dataset is loaded, and its structure and content are examined.

Data Cleaning and Wrangling: Duplicate records and missing values are handled. Data wrangling techniques are applied to transform and clean the dataset.

Exploratory Data Analysis: Visualizations are created to explore relationships between variables, understand customer behavior, and identify patterns.

Customer Segmentation: Three clustering algorithms (K-means, hierarchical, and DBSCAN) are applied to identify major customer segments. Hyperparameters are tuned, and models are evaluated using appropriate performance metrics.

Model Evaluation and Selection: The best-performing clustering model is selected as the final prediction model based on evaluation metrics.

Interpretation and Insights: The results of the customer segmentation analysis are interpreted to provide actionable insights for the retail company. Recommendations are made to improve marketing strategies, customer satisfaction, and overall business performance.

Model Deployment: The chosen model is saved for future use. A sanity check is performed by loading the saved model and making predictions on unseen data.
